Validating HTML code is a critical step in web development that ensures your website meets the standards set by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). This validation process helps identify errors and potential issues in your HTML code, which can affect your site's accessibility, performance, and cross-browser compatibility.

## Why Validate HTML Code?

- **Web Standards Compliance**: Adhering to W3C standards helps ensure your website can be correctly interpreted by different web browsers and devices.
- **Accessibility**: Valid HTML is more likely to be accessible to people with disabilities, as it's easier for screen readers and other assistive technologies to interpret.
- **SEO Benefits**: Search engines favor well-structured, error-free HTML code, which can improve your site's visibility in search results.
- **Improved User Experience**: Websites with valid HTML are more likely to render correctly across various browsers and devices, leading to a better user experience.

## How to Validate HTML Code

You can validate your HTML code using the W3C Markup Validation Service, a free tool available online. Simply enter your website's URL or upload your HTML file, and the tool will check it for compliance with web standards.
