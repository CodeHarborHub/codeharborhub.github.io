HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language used for creating web pages. It consists of various tags and elements that define the structure and content of a web page.

## HTML Tags

HTML tags are the building blocks of an HTML document. They are enclosed in angle brackets (`<>`) and are used to define the structure and formatting of the content. Tags are usually paired with an opening tag and a closing tag, with the content placed between them.

For example, the `<h1>` tag is used to define a heading, and it is written as `<h1>Heading</h1>`. The opening tag `<h1>` indicates the start of the heading, and the closing tag `</h1>` indicates the end of the heading.

HTML elements are made up of tags, along with the content placed between them. An element consists of an opening tag, the content, and a closing tag. The content can be text, images, links, or other HTML elements.

For example, in the HTML element `<p> This is a paragraph.</p>`, `<p>` and `</p>` are HTML tags, and the entire string together is considered an HTML element
