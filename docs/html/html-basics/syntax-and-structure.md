HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It describes the structure of a web page and consists of a series of elements. HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content.

## HTML Syntax

HTML syntax consists of a set of elements, tags, attributes, and their combinations. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Elements** : HTML documents are built using elements, which are structured by HTML tags. Elements typically consist of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag.
    ```html
        <tagname>Content goes here</tagname>
    ```

    For example:
    
    <Tabs>
        <TabItem value="HTML">
        ```html
        <p>This is a paragraph element.</p>
        ```
        </TabItem>
        <TabItem value="Output">
           <BrowserWindow url="http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html">
              <p>This is a paragraph element.</p>
           </BrowserWindow>
        </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

    Elements can be nested within each other to create complex structures. For example:
    
    <Tabs>
        <TabItem value="HTML">
        ```html
        <div>
            <h1>This is a heading</h1>
            <p>This is a paragraph element.</p>
        </div>
        ```
        </TabItem>
        <TabItem value="Output">
           <BrowserWindow url="http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html">
              <div>
                  <h1>This is a heading</h1>
                  <p>This is a paragraph element.</p>
              </div>
           </BrowserWindow>
        </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

2. **Tags**: Tags are keywords enclosed in angle brackets `<>` that define the structure and content of HTML elements. They can be categorized into two types:


    - **Opening Tags** : They denote the beginning of an element and have the tag name wrapped in angle brackets.
    ```html
        <tagname>
    ```
    -  **Closing Tags** : They denote the end of an element and have the tag name wrapped in angle brackets, preceded by a forward slash `/`.

    ```html
        </tagname>
    ```
    
    - Some tags, like `<img>`, `<input>`, and `<br>`, are self-closing and do not require a separate closing tag.

3. **Attributes** : HTML elements can have attributes that provide additional information about them. Attributes are added to the opening tag and are written as name-value pairs.
    ```html
        <tagname attribute="value">
    ```

    For example:
        ```html
            <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description">
        ```

## HTML Structure

HTML documents have a hierarchical structure consisting of various elements. Here's a breakdown of the structure:


Here's a basic HTML structure:

1. `<!DOCTYPE html>` : Declares the document type and version of HTML.
2. `<html>` : The root element of the HTML document.
3. `<head>` : Contains meta-information about the document, such as character encoding, viewport settings, and title.
4. `<meta charset="UTF-8">` : Specifies the character encoding of the document.
5. `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">` : Sets the viewport properties for responsive design.
6. `<title>` : Defines the title of the document.
7. `<body>` : Contains the visible content of the HTML document.
8. `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>` : Semantic HTML5 elements for structuring the header, main content, and footer sections of the page.
9. `<section>, <article>, <aside>`: Additional semantic HTML5 elements for organizing content within the main section of the page.
10. `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<h5>`, `<h6>`: Heading elements to define the hierarchy of headings in the document.
11. `<p>`: Paragraph element to define text content.
12. `<a>`: Anchor element for creating hyperlinks.
13. `<img>`: Image element for displaying images.

```html title="index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Your Page Title</title>
    <!-- Additional meta tags, stylesheets, and scripts can be included here -->
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <!-- Header content goes here -->
    </header>
    <main>
        <!-- Main content goes here -->
    </main>
    <footer>
        <!-- Footer content goes here -->
    </footer>
</body>
</html>
```

Understanding the syntax and structure of HTML is essential for creating well-structured and semantically meaningful web pages. By mastering these concepts, you can effectively design and develop web content that is accessible, responsive, and user-friendly.
