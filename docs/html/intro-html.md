HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages. HTML describes the structure of a Web page. HTML consists of a series of elements that you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.

## What is HTML?

HTML, which stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, is the standard markup language for creating Web pages and design documents on the World Wide Web. It is a system of tags and codes that define the structure and presentation of text and images in a document. HTML is a markup language, not a programming language, and is used to create static web pages that are displayed in web browsers. HTML is important because it provides a standardized way to define elements, making it easier for computers and software applications to interpret and display the content correctly.

1.  **Markup Language**: Markup language is a system of rules that uses tags or codes to define the structure and presentation of text and images in a document. HTML is a markup language. Markup languages are different from programming languages, which are used to create web applications, and are static and don't use logic or algorithms. Markup languages are important because they provide a standardized way to define elements, making it easier for computers and software applications to interpret and display the content correctly.
2.  **Hyper Text**: HyperText is text which is not constrained to be linear. It can contain links to other web pages. The World Wide Web is a classic example of hyper text, with web pages containing links to other pages, sometimes in other websites. HyperText is the method by which you move around on the web â€” by clicking on special text called hyperlinks which bring you to the next page.
3.  Different between Markup Language and Programming Language:

        | No. | Markup Language | Programming Language |
        | --- | --------------- | -------------------- |
        | 1.  | It is used to define the structure and presentation of text and images in a document. | It is used to create web applications. |
        | 2.  | It is static and doesn't use logic or algorithms. | It is dynamic and uses logic and algorithms. |
        | 3.  | It provides a standardized way to define elements. | It provides a way to create web applications. |
        | 4.  | It is used to create web pages. | It is used to create web applications. |

4.  **Structure and Content**: HTML is used to define the structure and content of a web page. It consists of a series of elements that you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.

    **For example, the following HTML code creates a simple web page:**

     <Tabs>

       ```html
       <!DOCTYPE html>
       <html>
         <head>
           <title>Page Title</title>
         </head>
         <body>
           <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
           <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
         </body>
       </html>
       ```
       </TabItem>
       <TabItem value="Output">
       <BrowserWindow url="http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html">
       <div>
         <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
         <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
       </div>
     </BrowserWindow>
     </TabItem>

## How to use HTML?

HTML is used to create structured documents for the web. To start using HTML, you'll need a basic understanding of its syntax and structure, as well as a text editor to write your code and a web browser to view your web pages.

### Steps to start using HTML

**1. Set up your development environment**: To start using HTML, you'll need a text editor to write your code and a web browser to view your web pages. You can use any text editor, such as Notepad, Sublime Text, Visual Studio Code, or Atom, to write your HTML code. You can also use an online code editor, such as CodePen, or JSFiddle, to write and test your HTML code. You can use any web browser, such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, or Safari, to view your web pages.

**2. Create your first HTML document**: To create your first HTML document, follow these steps:

    - Open your text editor and create a new file with an `.html` extension, such as `index.html`.
    - Add the following code to your file:

      ```html title="index.html"
      <!DOCTYPE html>
      <html>
        <head>
          <title>My First HTML Document</title>
        </head>
        <body>
          <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
          <p>This is my first HTML document.</p>
        </body>
      </html>
      ```

    - Save your file and open it in a web browser. You should see the text "Hello, World!" displayed in the browser window.

      <BrowserWindow url="http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html">
       <div>
        <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
        <p>This is my first HTML document.</p>
       </div>
      </BrowserWindow>

**3. Learn HTML syntax and structure**: HTML consists of a series of elements that you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. Each element is enclosed in angle brackets `< >` and consists of a start tag, content, and an end tag. For example, the `<h1>` element is used to define a heading, and the `<p>` element is used to define a paragraph.

**4. Explore HTML elements and attributes**: HTML provides a wide range of elements and attributes that you can use to create structured documents for the web. Some common HTML elements include headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, tables, forms, and more. Each element has its own purpose and can be customized using attributes, such as `id`, `class`, `style`, `src`, `href`, and more.
