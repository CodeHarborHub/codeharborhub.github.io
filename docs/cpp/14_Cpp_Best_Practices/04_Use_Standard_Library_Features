description: In this tutorial, We Leverage the rich features of the C++ Standard Library. It provides a vast collection of containers, algorithms, and utilities that can simplify your code and make it more expressive. Use containers like `std::vector`, `std::map`, and algorithms from the `<algorithm>` header to avoid reinventing the wheel and to take advantage of optimized, well-tested code.

C++ Standard Library
1. Containers:

vector, list, deque, set, map: Standard container classes.

2. Algorithms:

algorithm: Functions for sorting, searching, and manipulating ranges of elements.
numeric: Numeric operations on ranges of elements.

3. Utilities:

utility: General-purpose utilities like pair and tuple.
functional: Function objects, binders, and reference wrappers.

4. I/O:

iostream: Standard input/output stream objects.
fstream: File stream classes.
sstream: String stream classes.

5. Concurrency:

thread: Support for multithreading.
mutex: Mutual exclusion primitives.
future: Support for asynchronous operations.

6. Math and Random:

cmath: Mathematical functions.
random: Random number generation.
