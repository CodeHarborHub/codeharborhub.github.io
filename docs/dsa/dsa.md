## Introduction

Data Structures and Algorithms are the fundamental concepts that every programmer must know. They are the tools you'll use to build software systems. Data Structures are a way of organizing and storing data so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. Algorithms are a set of instructions to solve a problem or perform a task.

## What is Algorithm?

An algorithm is a set of instructions to solve a problem or perform a task. It is a step-by-step procedure that defines a set of actions to be executed in a certain order to get the desired output.

### Quility of Good Algorithm 

- **Correctness**: An algorithm is correct if it produces the correct result for all instances of the problem it is designed to solve.
- **Efficiency**: An algorithm is efficient if it solves the problem within the resources (like time and space) available to it.
- **Simplicity**: An algorithm is simple if it is easy to understand and implement.
- **Optimality**: An algorithm is optimal if it produces the best result among all possible solutions for the given problem.
- **Scalability**: An algorithm is scalable if it can handle the input size efficiently.
- **Adaptability**: An algorithm is adaptable if it can be easily modified to solve a different problem.
- **Robustness**: An algorithm is robust if it can handle invalid input without crashing.
- **Maintainability**: An algorithm is maintainable if it can be easily modified and maintained.
- **Reusability**: An algorithm is reusable if it can be used in different programs.

### Algorithm Examples 

- **Sorting Algorithms**: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, Radix Sort, Counting Sort, Bucket Sort, etc.
- **Searching Algorithms**: Linear Search, Binary Search, Jump Search, Interpolation Search, Exponential Search, etc.
- **Graph Algorithms**: Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), Dijkstra's Algorithm, Bellman-Ford Algorithm, Floyd-Warshall Algorithm, Prim's Algorithm, Kruskal's Algorithm, etc.
- **Dynamic Programming Algorithms**: Fibonacci Series, Longest Common Subsequence, Longest Increasing Subsequence, Knapsack Problem, Matrix Chain Multiplication, etc.
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Fractional Knapsack Problem, Job Sequencing Problem, Huffman Coding, Prim's Algorithm, Kruskal's Algorithm, etc.
- **Divide and Conquer Algorithms**: Binary Search, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Strassen's Algorithm, etc.
- **Backtracking Algorithms**: N-Queens Problem, Sudoku Solver, Knight's Tour, Rat in a Maze, etc.
- **Branch and Bound Algorithms**: Traveling Salesman Problem, 0/1 Knapsack Problem, Job Assignment Problem, etc.
- **Randomized Algorithms**: Randomized Quick Sort, Randomized Selection, Las Vegas Algorithm, Monte Carlo Algorithm, etc.
- **Approximation Algorithms**: Traveling Salesman Problem, Knapsack Problem, Set Cover Problem, etc.

## What is Data Structure?

A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. It is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data. Data structures are used to represent data in a meaningful way. They provide a way to store and organize data in memory.

### Types of Data Structures

Data structures can be classified into two categories:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Data Structures] --> B[Primative Data Structures]
    A[Data Structures] --> C[Non-Primative Data Structures]

    B[Primative Data Structures] --> D(Integer)
    B[Primative Data Structures] --> EFloat
    B[Primative Data Structures] --> F(Character)
    B[Primative Data Structures] --> G(Boolean)

    C[Non-Primative Data Structures] --> H[Linear Data Structures]
    C[Non-Primative Data Structures] --> I[Non-Linear Data Structures]

    H[Linear Data Structures] --> J[Static Data Structures]
    H[Linear Data Structures] --> K[Dynamic Data Structures]

    J[Static Data Structures] --> L(Array)

    K[Dynamic Data Structures] --> M(Linked List)
    K[Dynamic Data Structures] --> N(Stack)
    K[Dynamic Data Structures] --> O(Queue)

    I[Non-Linear Data Structures] --> Q(Trees)
    I[Non-Linear Data Structures] --> R(Graphs)
    
```

1. **Primitive Data Structures**: These are the basic data structures that are directly operated upon by the machine instructions. They include Integer, Float, Character, Boolean, etc.
2. **Non-Primitive Data Structures**: These are the advanced data structures that are derived from primitive data structures. They include Linear Data Structures (Array, Linked List, Stack, Queue), Non-Linear Data Structures (Trees, Graphs), etc.

### Data Structure Examples

- **Array**: A collection of elements of the same data type stored in contiguous memory locations.
- **Linked List**: A collection of elements called nodes, where each node contains a data field and a reference (link) to the next node in the sequence.
- **Stack**: A collection of elements with two main operations: push (insert) and pop (delete).
- **Queue**: A collection of elements with two main operations: enqueue (insert) and dequeue (delete).
- **Tree**: A hierarchical data structure with a root node and subtrees of children nodes.
- **Graph**: A non-linear data structure consisting of nodes (vertices) and edges (connections between nodes).
- **Hash Table**: A data structure that stores key-value pairs and provides fast lookup of values based on keys.
- **Heap**: A specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property.
