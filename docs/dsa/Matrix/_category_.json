      "description": "In data structures and algorithms (DSA), a matrix is a two-dimensional array consisting of rows and columns. It is often used to represent a grid-like structure or a table of values. Matrices are commonly used in various algorithms and mathematical operations, such as matrix multiplication, graph algorithms, image processing, and more. They provide a convenient way to organize and manipulate data in a structured manner."
