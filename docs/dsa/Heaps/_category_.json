    "description": "Heaps are a type of binary tree-based data structure that satisfy the heap property. They are commonly used to implement priority queues and efficiently find the maximum or minimum element. Heaps can be either max heaps or min heaps, depending on whether the parent nodes are greater or smaller than their children. Operations like insertion, deletion, and retrieval of the maximum or minimum element can be performed efficiently on heaps."
