    ```bash
    mkdir my-project
    cd my-project
    ```

2. **Initialize a new Node.js project**:
    ```bash
    npm init -y
    ```

### Step 2: Install Nodemailer

```bash
npm install nodemailer
```

This command will install Nodemailer and add it to your `package.json` file as a dependency.

### Setp 3: How Import

- In node & Express Js
```bash
const nodemailer=require('nodemailer')
```

```bash
import nodemailer from 'nodemailer'
