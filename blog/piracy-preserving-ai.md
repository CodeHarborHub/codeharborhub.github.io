## Introduction

Privacy-Preserving AI is an emerging field focused on protecting individuals' privacy while enabling the use of AI for data analysis and decision-making. This documentation covers various techniques and applications, exploring how AI can be developed and deployed without compromising data privacy.

## Differential Privacy

### Overview
Differential privacy ensures that the output of an algorithm does not reveal whether any individualâ€™s data was included in the input. It adds noise to the data, providing privacy guarantees while retaining the data's utility.

### Applications
- **Data Analysis:** Used in statistical analysis to protect individual records.
- **Machine Learning:** Applied to training data to prevent model inversion attacks.

## Homomorphic Encryption

### Overview
Homomorphic encryption allows computations to be performed on encrypted data without decrypting it. The results, when decrypted, match the output of operations performed on the plaintext.

### Applications
- **Secure Data Processing:** Enables computation on sensitive data without exposure.
- **Cloud Computing:** Allows cloud providers to process encrypted data without accessing the raw data.

## Federated Learning

### Overview
Federated learning trains machine learning models across multiple decentralized devices or servers while keeping the data localized. This approach enhances privacy by ensuring data never leaves its source.

### Applications
- **Healthcare:** Aggregating patient data from multiple hospitals for model training.
- **Mobile Devices:** Training models across users' devices without data centralization.

## Privacy-Preserving Data Sharing

### Overview
Techniques for privacy-preserving data sharing include anonymization, pseudonymization, and secure multi-party computation. These methods allow data to be shared and analyzed without compromising individual privacy.

### Applications
- **Collaborative Research:** Sharing data between institutions while maintaining privacy.
- **Public Data Releases:** Releasing datasets for public use with privacy protections.

## AI Model Privacy Attacks and Defenses

### Overview
AI models can be vulnerable to privacy attacks such as membership inference and model inversion. Defenses include differential privacy, secure enclaves, and adversarial training.

### Applications
- **Model Security:** Enhancing the robustness of AI models against privacy attacks.
- **Data Protection:** Ensuring sensitive information is not leaked through model outputs.

## Ethical Considerations in Privacy-Preserving AI

### Overview
Ethical considerations involve balancing the benefits of AI with the need to protect individual privacy. This includes transparency, consent, and fairness in AI applications.

### Applications
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Ensuring AI systems comply with privacy laws and regulations.
- **Trust Building:** Enhancing user trust in AI systems by prioritizing privacy.
