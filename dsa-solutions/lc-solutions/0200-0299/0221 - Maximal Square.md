## Problem

You are given an m x n binary $matrix$ filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest square containing only 1's and return its area.

### Examples

**Example 1:**

**Input:** matrix = [["1","0","1","0","0"],["1","0","1","1","1"],["1","1","1","1","1"],["1","0","0","1","0"]]

**Output:** 4

**Example 2:**

**Input:** matrix = [["0","1"],["1","0"]]

**Output:** 1

**Example 3:**

**Input:** matrix = [["0"]]

**Output:** 0

### Constraints

- $m == matrix.length$
- $n == matrix[i].length$
- $1 <= m, n <= 300$
- $matrix[i][j]$ is $0$ or $1$

---

## Approach

There are four approaches discussed that helps to obtain the solution:

1. **Dynamic Programming Table**:

   - Use a 2D DP array **'dp'** where **'dp[i][j]'** represents the side length of the largest square whose bottom-right corner is at position **'(i, j)'**.
   - The value of **'dp[i][j]'** is determined by the values of **'dp[i-1][j]'**, **'dp[i][j-1]'**, and **'dp[i-1][j-1]'**.

2. **Transition**:
   - If **'matrix[i][j]'** is $1$:

     - If **'i'** or **'j'** is $0$ (first row or first column), **'dp[i][j]'** is $1$ because the largest square ending there can only be of $size1$.
     - Otherwise, **'dp[i][j]'** is the minimum of **'dp[i-1][j]'**, **'dp[i][j-1]'**, and **'dp[i-1][j-1]'** plus $1$. This is because we can form a larger square only if all three adjacent squares can also form squares of $1's$.
3. **Max Side Length**:

   - Track the maximum side length of squares found during the iteration.

4. **Result**:
   - The area of the largest square is the square of the maximum side length found.

## Solution for Maximal Square

This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The problem requires to Utilize a DP table where each entry represents the side length of the largest square ending at that position.

#### Code in Java

```java
class Solution {
   public int maximalSquare(char[][] matrix) {
       if (matrix == null || matrix.length == 0 || matrix[0].length == 0) {
           return 0;
       }

       int rows = matrix.length;
       int cols = matrix[0].length;
       int maxSide = 0;

       // Create a DP array to store the size of the largest square ending at each position
       int[][] dp = new int[rows][cols];

       // Fill the DP array
       for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
           for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
               if (matrix[i][j] == '1') {
                   if (i == 0 || j == 0) {
                       // If we're at the first row or first column, the largest square ending here is just 1
                       dp[i][j] = 1;
                   } else {
                       // Otherwise, calculate the size of the square based on the surrounding squares
                       dp[i][j] = Math.min(Math.min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]), dp[i-1][j-1]) + 1;
                   }
                   // Update the maximum side length found
                   maxSide = Math.max(maxSide, dp[i][j]);
               }
           }
       }

       // The area of the largest square is side length squared
       return maxSide * maxSide;
   }
}

```

### Complexity Analysis

#### Time Complexity: O($m$ x $n$)

> **Reason**: The algorithm involves iterating through each cell of the matrix once, leading to a time complexity of $ùëÇ(ùëö √ó ùëõ)$, where $ùëö$ is the number of rows and $ùëõ$ is the number of columns.

#### Space Complexity: O($m$ √ó $n$)

> **Reason**: The space complexity is $ùëÇ(ùëö √ó ùëõ)$ due to the additional DP array used. This could be optimized to $O(n)$ by reusing a single row of DP values, but in the given solution, we use a full 2D DP array.
