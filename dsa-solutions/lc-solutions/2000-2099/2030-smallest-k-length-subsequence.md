## Problem Description

You are given a string s, an integer k, a letter letter, and an integer repetition.

Return the lexicographically smallest subsequence of s of length k that has the letter letter appear at least repetition times. The test cases are generated so that the letter appears in s at least repetition times.

A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if in the first position where a and b differ, string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b.

### Examples

**Example 1**
```
Input: s = "leet", k = 3, letter = "e", repetition = 1
Output: "eet"
Explanation: There are four subsequences of length 3 that have the letter 'e' appear at least 1 time:

"lee" (from "leet")
"let" (from "leet")
"let" (from "leet")
"eet" (from "leet")
The lexicographically smallest subsequence among them is "eet".
```

**Example 2**
```
Input: s = "leetcode", k = 4, letter = "e", repetition = 2
Output: "ecde"
Explanation: "ecde" is the lexicographically smallest subsequence of length 4 that has the letter "e" appear at least 2 times.
```

**Example 3**
```
Input: s = "bb", k = 2, letter = "b", repetition = 2
Output: "bb"
Explanation: "bb" is the only subsequence of length 2 that has the letter "b" appear at least 2 times.
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= repetition <= k <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
- `letter` is a lowercase English letter, and appears in `s` at least `repetition` times.

### Approach

To solve this problem, use a greedy algorithm to construct the subsequence while maintaining the conditions. Use a stack to keep track of the smallest possible sequence and ensure that the required conditions (length and number of occurrences of the specified letter) are met.

#### C++ 

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string smallestSubsequence(string s, int k, char letter, int repetition) {
        int n = s.size();
        int count = 0;
        for (char c : s) {
            if (c == letter) count++;
        }

        string result = "";
        int letterCount = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            while (!result.empty() && result.back() > s[i] && result.size() - 1 + n - i >= k && 
                   letterCount + (result.back() == letter ? -1 : 0) + count >= repetition) {
                letterCount -= result.back() == letter;
                result.pop_back();
            }
            
            if (result.size() < k) {
                result.push_back(s[i]);
                letterCount += s[i] == letter;
                if (s[i] == letter) repetition--;
            }
            count -= s[i] == letter;
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```
