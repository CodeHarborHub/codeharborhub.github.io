## Problem Description

You own a Goal Parser that can interpret a string command. The command consists of an alphabet of "G", "()" and/or "(al)" in some order. The Goal Parser will interpret "G" as the string "G", "()" as the string "o", and "(al)" as the string "al". The interpreted strings are then concatenated in the original order.

Given the string command, return the Goal Parser's interpretation of command.

 
 

### Examples

**Example 1:**

```
Input: command = "G()(al)"
Output: "Goal"
Explanation: The Goal Parser interprets the command as follows:
G -> G
() -> o
(al) -> al
The final concatenated result is "Goal".
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: command = "G()()()()(al)"
Output: "Gooooal"
 
 ```
## Complexity Analysis

*** Time Complexity:** $O(1)$

*** Space Complexity:** $O(1)$

### Constraints

- `1 <= command.length <= 100`
- `command` consists of `"G"`, `"()"`, and/or `"(al)"` in some order.



### Solution
## Approach
To interpret the given command string, the approach involves replacing specific substrings within the command to their corresponding interpreted values. The command may contain the substrings "()" and "(al)", which need to be replaced with "o" and "al", respectively. The process can be efficiently achieved using the replace`method available in most programming languages, which allows us to replace all occurrences of a substring with another substring.

Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. Identify Substrings: Determine the specific substrings in the command that need to be replaced. In this case, "()" should be replaced with "o", and "(al)" should be replaced with "al".
2. Replace Substrings: Use the replace method to perform the replacements. First, replace all occurrences of "()" with "o". Then, replace all occurrences of "(al)" with "al".
3. Return the Result: After performing the replacements, the resulting string is the interpreted command.

This approach ensures that the command string is correctly transformed in a single pass through each replace operation, making it efficient and straightforward to implement.
