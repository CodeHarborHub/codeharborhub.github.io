## Problem

You are given an array arr[], and you have to re-construct an array arr[].

The values in arr[] are obtained by doing Xor of consecutive elements in the array.

### Examples:
**Example 1:**
```
Input : n=5, arr[ ] = {10, 11, 1, 2, 3}
Output : 1 10 3 1 3
Explanation:
At index 0, arr[0] xor arr[1] = 1
At index 1, arr[1] xor arr[2] = 10
At index 2, arr[2] xor arr[3] = 3
...
At index 4, No element is left So, it will remain as
it is.
New Array will be {1, 10, 3, 1, 3}.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input : n=4, arr[ ] = {5, 9, 7, 6}
Output :  12 14 1 6
Explanation:
At index 0, arr[0] xor arr[1] = 12
At index 1, arr[1] xor arr[2] = 14
At index 2, arr[2] xor arr[3] = 1
At index 3, No element is left So, it will remain as it is.
New Array will be {12, 14, 1, 6}.
```

### Your task:

This is a function problem. The input is already taken care of by the driver code. You only need to complete the function **game_with_number()** that takes an array (arr), sizeOfArray (n) and return the array re-constructed array arr. The driver code takes care of the printing.

- **Expected Time Complexity:** $O(N)$
- **Expected Auxiliary Space:** $O(1)$

### Constraints:

- $1<=N<=10^5$
- $1<=arr[i]<=10^7$

## Solution
### Python
```python
def game_with_number (arr,  n) : 
    for i in range(0,n-1):
        arr[i] = arr[i]^arr[i+1]
    return arr
```

### Java
```java
public static int[] game_with_number (int arr[], int n) {
    for(int i = 0; i<n-1; i++) {
        arr[i] = arr[i]^arr[i+1];
    }
    return arr;
}
```

### C++
```cpp
int* game_with_number(int arr[], int n) {
    for(int i = 0; i<n-1; i++) {
        arr[i] = arr[i]^arr[i+1];
    }
    return arr;
}
```

### C
```c
int* game_with_number(int arr[], int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        arr[i] = arr[i] ^ arr[i + 1];
    }
    return arr;
}
```

- **Time Complexity:** $O(N)$
- **Auxiliary Space:** $O(1)$
