## What is Pattern Matching with Wildcards?

Pattern Matching with Wildcards is an advanced search algorithm that extends traditional pattern matching by allowing wildcard characters ('*') to represent any sequence of characters (including empty sequence) during the search process. This approach is useful for flexible and efficient text searching in various applications.

## Algorithm Steps

1. **Initialization**:
   - Prepare the pattern with wildcards and the text to search within.

2. **Pattern Matching**:
   - Iterate through the pattern and text character by character.
   - Handle wildcard characters ('*') to match any sequence of characters or positions.

3. **Matching Strategy**:
   - Use dynamic programming or a recursive approach to efficiently handle wildcard expansion and pattern matching.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: Depends on the specific implementation. It can range from $O(m \times n) )$ to $ O(m + n) $, where $m$ is the length of the pattern and $n$ is the length of the text.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(m \times n) )$ in worst cases due to the potential recursion depth or dynamic programming table.

## Example

Given a pattern with wildcards and a text:

```

pattern = "acd"
text = "abcd"

```

Using Pattern Matching with Wildcards:

- Match the pattern against the text, considering '*' as a wildcard that matches any sequence of characters.

```python
def pattern_matching_with_wildcards(pattern, text):
    # Dynamic programming approach
    m, n = len(pattern), len(text)
    dp = [[False] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
    dp[0][0] = True
    
    # Handle initial wildcard characters
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        if pattern[i - 1] == '*':
            dp[i][0] = dp[i - 1][0]
    
    # Fill dp table
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if pattern[i - 1] == '*':
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] or dp[i][j - 1]
            elif pattern[i - 1] == '?' or pattern[i - 1] == text[j - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1]
    
    return dp[m][n]

# Example usage:
pattern = "a*c*d"
text = "abcd"

if pattern_matching_with_wildcards(pattern, text):
    print(f"Pattern '{pattern}' matches text '{text}'")
else:
    print(f"Pattern '{pattern}' does not match text '{text}'")
```

        }
    }
    
    return dp[m][n];
}

int main() {
    std::string pattern = "a*c*d";
    std::string text = "abcd";
    
    if (pattern_matching_with_wildcards(pattern, text)) {
        std::cout << "Pattern '" << pattern << "' matches text '" << text << "'\n";
    } else {
        std::cout << "Pattern '" << pattern << "' does not match text '" << text << "'\n";
    }
    
    return 0;

# Conclusion
Pattern Matching with Wildcards is a versatile algorithm that allows for flexible matching of patterns containing wildcard characters ('*') against text sequences. It is useful in various applications such as text processing, file search utilities, and more where flexible and efficient pattern matching is required.
