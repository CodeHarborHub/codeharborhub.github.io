# Tower of Hanoi

## Description

The Tower of Hanoi is a classic problem in recursive programming. This project provides a C++ implementation of the Tower of Hanoi algorithm, demonstrating how to move a set of disks from one peg to another using a temporary peg, following the rules of the game.

## Rules

1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty peg.
3. No larger disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

## Installation

To run the Tower of Hanoi program, you need a C++ compiler. You can use g++ or any other C++ compiler of your choice.
