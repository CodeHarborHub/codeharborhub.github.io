# A* Algorithm

The A* Algorithm is an informed search algorithm used for finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. It is widely used in various applications such as pathfinding for games, AI, and robotics due to its efficiency and accuracy.

## How A* Algorithm Works

The A* Algorithm combines the advantages of Dijkstra's Algorithm and Greedy Best-First Search. It uses a priority queue to explore nodes based on the cost function:

ùëì(ùëõ)=ùëî(ùëõ)+‚Ñé(ùëõ)

Where:
g(n) is the cost from the start node to the current node.
h(n) is the heuristic function that estimates the cost from the current node n to the goal node.

## Heuristics in A* Algorithm
The choice of the heuristic function h(n) is crucial for the efficiency of the A* Algorithm. Common heuristics include:

1. **Manhattan Distance:** Used for grid-based maps.
2. **Euclidean Distance:** Used for geometric spaces.
3. **Chebyshev Distance:** Used when diagonal movement is allowed.
The heuristic function should be admissible, meaning it never overestimates the actual cost to reach the goal.

## Complexity Analysis
The time complexity of the A* Algorithm is 
ùëÇ(ùëèùëë)

WHERE:
b is the branching factor (the average number of successors per state) and 
d is the depth of the goal. The space complexity is also 
ùëÇ(ùëèùëë) as it needs to store all generated nodes in the worst case.

## Comparison with Other Algorithms

1. **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** A* is generally faster because it uses heuristics to guide its search, while Dijkstra's explores all possible paths.
2. **Greedy Best-First Search:** A* is more accurate because it takes into account both the actual cost from the start and the estimated cost to the goal, while Greedy Best-First only considers the latter.

## Common Applications

1. **Game Development:** For pathfinding characters in video games.
2. **Robotics:** For navigating robots through environments.
3. **Geographic Information Systems (GIS):** For finding the shortest route in maps.

## Pseudocode
Here is the pseudocode for the A* Algorithm:

    ```pseudo
    function A*(start, goal)
        openSet := {start}
        cameFrom := empty map
        gScore := map with default value of Infinity
        gScore[start] := 0
        fScore := map with default value of Infinity
        fScore[start] := heuristic(start, goal)

        while openSet is not empty
            current := node in openSet with lowest fScore[] value
            if current == goal
                return reconstruct_path(cameFrom, current)

            openSet.Remove(current)
            for each neighbor of current
                tentative_gScore := gScore[current] + d(current, neighbor)
                if tentative_gScore < gScore[neighbor]
                    cameFrom[neighbor] := current
                    gScore[neighbor] := tentative_gScore
                    fScore[neighbor] := gScore[neighbor] + heuristic(neighbor, goal)
                    if neighbor not in openSet
                        openSet.Add(neighbor)

        return failure

    function reconstruct_path(cameFrom, current)
        total_path := {current}
        while current in cameFrom.Keys
            current := cameFrom[current]
            total_path.Prepend(current)
        return total_path
    ````

## Implementation in Python
    ```python
        import heapq

        def heuristic(a, b):
            return abs(a[0] - b[0]) + abs(a[1] - b[1])

        def a_star(graph, start, goal):
            open_set = []
            heapq.heappush(open_set, (0, start))
            came_from = {}
            g_score = {start: 0}
            f_score = {start: heuristic(start, goal)}

            while open_set:
                _, current = heapq.heappop(open_set)

                if current == goal:
                    return reconstruct_path(came_from, current)

                for neighbor in graph[current]:
                    tentative_g_score = g_score[current] + graph[current][neighbor]
                    if tentative_g_score < g_score.get(neighbor, float('inf')):
                        came_from[neighbor] = current
                        g_score[neighbor] = tentative_g_score
                        f_score[neighbor] = g_score[neighbor] + heuristic(neighbor, goal)
                        heapq.heappush(open_set, (f_score[neighbor], neighbor))

            return None

        def reconstruct_path(came_from, current):
            path = [current]
            while current in came_from:
                current = came_from[current]
                path.append(current)
            return path[::-1]


        # Example usage
        graph = {
            (0, 0): {(0, 1): 1, (1, 0): 1},
            (0, 1): {(0, 0): 1, (1, 1): 1, (0, 2): 1},
            (1, 0): {(0, 0): 1, (1, 1): 1, (2, 0): 1},
            (1, 1): {(1, 0): 1, (0, 1): 1, (1, 2): 1, (2, 1): 1},

            (1, 2): {(1, 1): 1, (0, 2): 1, (2, 2): 1},
            (2, 2): {(2, 1): 1, (1, 2): 1},
        }
