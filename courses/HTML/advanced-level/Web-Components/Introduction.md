Web Components are a set of web platform APIs that allow developers to create reusable, encapsulated custom elements. They provide a way to build complex user interfaces using a modular approach, enhancing maintainability and reusability of code across applications.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Encapsulation:** Styles and scripts are encapsulated within the component, preventing conflicts with other parts of the application.
- **Reusability:** Components can be reused across different projects or within the same project, promoting consistency and reducing redundancy.
- **Interoperability:** Web Components can work with any framework or library, making them versatile for various development environments.
