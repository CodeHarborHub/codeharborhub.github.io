### Web Accessibility Principles

Web accessibility refers to the practice of making websites usable by people of all abilities and disabilities. The goal is to ensure that everyone can access and interact with web content effectively.

**Key Principles (POUR):**

1. **Perceivable:** Information and user interface components must be presented in ways that users can perceive. This includes providing text alternatives for non-text content (e.g., images), ensuring sufficient color contrast, and making content adaptable to different formats.

2. **Operable:** User interface components and navigation must be operable. This means users must be able to interact with all controls and elements using various input methods, such as keyboard, mouse, or touch.

3. **Understandable:** Information and the operation of the user interface must be understandable. Users should be able to comprehend the content and how to use the interface, including clear language and predictable navigation.

4. **Robust:** Content must be robust enough to work with current and future user agents, including assistive technologies. This involves using valid HTML and adhering to web standards to ensure compatibility.
