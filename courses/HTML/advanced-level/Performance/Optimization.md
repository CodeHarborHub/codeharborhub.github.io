Optimizing HTML is crucial for improving the performance of a website. Here are key techniques to enhance HTML efficiency:

1. **Minification:**
   - Remove unnecessary whitespace, comments, and formatting from HTML files. This reduces file size and improves load times.
   - Use tools like [HTMLMinifier](https://kangax.github.io/html-minifier/) to automate the process.

2. **Use Semantic HTML:**
   - Utilize semantic elements (e.g., `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, `<section>`) to enhance accessibility and SEO while potentially improving rendering efficiency.

3. **Avoid Inline Styles:**
   - Keep CSS in external stylesheets instead of inline to reduce redundancy and promote caching.

4. **Optimize Images:**
   - Use appropriate image formats (e.g., WebP for web images) and ensure images are properly sized for display to reduce loading times.

5. **Remove Unused HTML:**
   - Audit your HTML to eliminate any unnecessary elements or attributes that may add bloat to the document.
