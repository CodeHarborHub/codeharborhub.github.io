Structured data markup helps search engines understand the content of your page more effectively, enabling rich snippets and enhancing search results with additional information.

**Benefits of Structured Data:**

1. **Rich Snippets:** Display enhanced search results, such as star ratings, event dates, and product prices.
   
2. **Improved Click-Through Rates:** Rich snippets attract more clicks by providing additional context.

3. **Enhanced Knowledge Graph:** Help search engines build richer knowledge graphs about your website.

**Using Schema.org:**

1. **Markup Types:**
   - Use specific schema types (e.g., Article, Product, Event) that match your content.
   - Include properties such as name, description, image, datePublished, etc.

2. **Implementation:**
   - Add structured data markup directly into HTML using JSON-LD, Microdata, or RDFa formats.
   - Validate your structured data using Google's Structured Data Testing Tool.

**Example of Article Schema:**
```html
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "http://schema.org",
  "@type": "Article",
  "mainEntityOfPage": {
    "@type": "WebPage",
    "@id": "https://www.example.com/article"
  },
  "headline": "SEO Best Practices",
  "image": "https://www.example.com/images/seo.jpg",
  "datePublished": "2024-07-17",
  "dateModified": "2024-07-17",
  "author": {
    "@type": "Person",
    "name": "Your Name"
  },
  "publisher": {
    "@type": "Organization",
    "name": "Your Organization",
    "logo": {
      "@type": "ImageObject",
      "url": "https://www.example.com/logo.png"
    }
  },
