Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are web applications that deliver a native app-like experience to users on the web. They combine the best features of both web and mobile applications, providing enhanced performance, offline capabilities, and improved user engagement. PWAs can be installed on users' devices and accessed from the home screen, similar to traditional apps.

**Key Features:**
- **Responsive:** PWAs work on any device and screen size, providing a consistent experience.
- **Offline Capable:** They can function without an internet connection through caching strategies.
- **App-like Interface:** PWAs offer a user interface that resembles a native app, including smooth animations and interactions.
- **Linkable:** Users can easily share and access PWAs via URLs without needing installation from an app store.
