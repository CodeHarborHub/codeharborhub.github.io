HTML entities are used to display reserved characters in HTML that would otherwise be interpreted as code, such as `<` and `>`. They can also be used to insert characters that are not available on a standard keyboard, like © or ™.

### Common HTML Entities

HTML entities start with an ampersand (`&`) and end with a semicolon (`;`). Here are some of the most commonly used HTML entities:

**Reserved Characters:**
- `&lt;` : `<` (less than)
- `&gt;` : `>` (greater than)
- `&amp;` : `&` (ampersand)
- `&quot;` : `"` (double quote)
- `&apos;` : `'` (single quote, apostrophe)

**Example:**
```html
<p>Use &lt; and &gt; to represent less than and greater than symbols.</p>
<p>Use &amp; to represent the ampersand symbol.</p>
<p>Use &quot; for double quotes and &apos; for single quotes.</p>
```

In this example, the reserved characters are displayed correctly without being interpreted as HTML tags.
