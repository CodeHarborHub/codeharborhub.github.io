The doctype declaration is an essential part of an HTML document that specifies the version of HTML being used. It helps the browser understand how to render the document correctly. For HTML5, the doctype declaration is simple and looks like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

In older versions of HTML, the doctype declaration was more complex, but with HTML5, it has been simplified to improve ease of use and reduce errors. It is important to include the doctype declaration at the very beginning of your HTML documents to ensure proper rendering and compatibility across different browsers.

**Key Points:**
- The doctype declaration is not a tag but an instruction to the browser.
- It must be the very first line in an HTML document, before the `<html>` tag.
- Different versions of HTML have different doctype declarations.
