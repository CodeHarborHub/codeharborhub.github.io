An HTML document has a specific structure that must be followed for browsers to interpret and display it correctly. The basic structure includes several key elements that define the document's head, body, and other important sections.

Here is an example of a simple HTML document structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First HTML Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to HTML</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph of text on my first HTML page.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

**Explanation of the Basic Structure:**
- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: This declaration defines the document type and version of HTML. For HTML5, it is written as `<!DOCTYPE html>`.
- `<html>`: This root element wraps all the content of the HTML document.
- `<head>`: Contains meta-information about the document, such as the title, character set, and links to stylesheets and scripts.
- `<title>`: Sets the title of the document, which appears in the browser tab.
- `<body>`: Contains the main content of the document, which is displayed in the browser window.
