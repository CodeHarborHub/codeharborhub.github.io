### What is HTML?
HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard language for creating web pages and web applications. It describes the structure of a webpage using a series of elements, which browsers interpret to display the content in a readable format. Each element in HTML represents different parts of the document, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and other multimedia elements.

HTML is the backbone of web development, and understanding its basics is essential for anyone looking to create web content. It is not a programming language but a markup language that defines the structure and presentation of web pages. HTML works in conjunction with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript to create dynamic and visually appealing websites.

**Key Points:**
- **HyperText**: Refers to the way HTML allows web pages to link to each other.
- **Markup**: Indicates that HTML uses tags to mark up the text.
- **Language**: Signifies that HTML has its own syntax and rules for defining the structure of a web document.
