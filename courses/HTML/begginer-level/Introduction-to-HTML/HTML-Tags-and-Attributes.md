HTML uses tags to mark up the content. Each tag has a specific purpose and defines how the content within it will be displayed. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets, and most have an opening tag and a closing tag. For example, a paragraph tag looks like this:

```html
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
```

Attributes provide additional information about an element and are included in the opening tag. They come in name/value pairs and are always written in lowercase. For example, the `href` attribute in an anchor tag specifies the URL of the link:

```html
<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example.com</a>
```

**Common HTML Tags:**
- `<h1>` to `<h6>`: Headings, with `<h1>` being the highest level and `<h6>` the lowest.
- `<p>`: Paragraph.
- `<a>`: Anchor (link).
- `<img>`: Image.
- `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`: Unordered list, ordered list, and list item.
- `<div>`: Division or section.
- `<span>`: Inline container.

**Common Attributes:**
- `id`: Unique identifier for an element.
- `class`: Class name for grouping multiple elements.
- `src`: Source URL for images and other media.
- `alt`: Alternative text for images.
- `style`: Inline CSS styles.
- `href`: URL for links.

Understanding the use of tags and attributes is fundamental to creating well-structured and functional HTML documents. By mastering these basics, you can begin building simple web pages and gradually add more complexity as you become more proficient.
