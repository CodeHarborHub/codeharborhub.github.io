Ensuring multimedia content is accessible to all users is crucial.

**For Audio:**
- Provide a text transcript for users who cannot hear the audio.

**For Video:**
- Provide subtitles or closed captions for users who cannot hear the audio.
- Provide a text transcript for users who cannot see the video.

**Example with Captions:**
```html
<video width="640" height="360" controls>
  <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <track src="subtitles_en.vtt" kind="subtitles" srclang="en" label="English">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
```
In this example, a subtitles file (`subtitles_en.vtt`) is linked using the `<track>` tag with `kind="subtitles"`, making the video accessible to users who need captions.

By using the `<audio>` and `<video>` tags along with their attributes, you can effectively embed and control multimedia content on your web pages, enhancing the user experience and ensuring accessibility.
