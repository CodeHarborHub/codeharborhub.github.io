**The `<span>` Element:**  
The `<span>` element is an inline container used to mark up a part of the text or a portion of a document. It does not introduce any line breaks and is often used to apply styles or classes to specific parts of the text.

Example:
```html
<p>This is a <span style="color: red;">red</span> word in a sentence.</p>
```

**The `<div>` Element:**  
The `<div>` element is a block-level container used to group larger sections of HTML elements. It often serves as a container for styling or scripting purposes and can contain other block-level or inline elements.

Example:
```html
<div style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px;">
  <h2>Section Title</h2>
  <p>This is a paragraph within a div element.</p>
</div>
```

**Usage and Importance:**
- **`<span>`**: Ideal for applying styles to inline elements without breaking the flow of text.
- **`<div>`**: Useful for creating structured sections and applying styles or scripts to larger blocks of content.

By mastering these text formatting and styling techniques, you can effectively control the presentation of content on your web pages, making them more engaging and user-friendly.
