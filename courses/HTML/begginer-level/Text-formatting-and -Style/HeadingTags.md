HTML provides various tags to format text, making it easier to structure content and enhance readability. 

**Headings:**  
HTML headings are used to define the headings of a document. There are six levels of headings, from `<h1>` to `<h6>`, with `<h1>` being the highest (or most important) level and `<h6>` the least important.

Example:
```html
<h1>This is a Heading 1</h1>
<h2>This is a Heading 2</h2>
<h3>This is a Heading 3</h3>
```

Headings help search engines understand the structure of your content and make it easier for users to skim through your web page.

**Paragraphs:**  
The `<p>` tag defines a paragraph. Browsers automatically add some space (margin) before and after each paragraph.

Example:
```html
<p>This is a paragraph of text. Paragraphs are blocks of text separated by whitespace to improve readability.</p>
```

**Text Formatting Tags:**  
HTML provides several tags for text formatting:
- **Bold (`<b>` or `<strong>`)**: Makes text bold.
- **Italic (`<i>` or `<em>`)**: Makes text italic.
- **Underline (`<u>`)**: Underlines text.
- **Strike-through (`<s>` or `<del>`)**: Strikes through text.

Example:
```html
<p>This is <b>bold</b> text.</p>
<p>This is <i>italic</i> text.</p>
<p>This is <u>underlined</u> text.</p>
<p>This is <s>strikethrough</s> text.</p>
```
