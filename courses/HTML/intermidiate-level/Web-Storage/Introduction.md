Web Storage is a feature of HTML5 that allows web applications to store data locally within the user's browser. It provides a more secure and faster way to store key/value pairs in a web browser. Unlike cookies, web storage data is not included with every server request, which improves performance. There are two main types of web storage: Local Storage and Session Storage.

**Benefits:**
- **Capacity:** Web storage provides a much larger storage capacity compared to cookies.
- **Performance:** Data is stored on the client-side and is not sent to the server with every HTTP request.
- **Simplicity:** API is straightforward to use, making it easy to store and retrieve data.
