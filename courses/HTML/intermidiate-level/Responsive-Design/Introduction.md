Responsive web design (RWD) ensures that web pages render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. This design approach uses flexible layouts, images, and cascading style sheet media queries to create a responsive experience for users, adapting the layout to the viewing environment.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Fluid Grid Layouts:** Using relative units like percentages instead of fixed units like pixels to allow elements to scale proportionally.
- **Flexible Images:** Ensuring images scale with the grid layout and remain within their containing elements.
- **Media Queries:** Applying different styles based on the characteristics of the device (such as screen width, height, resolution).

**Benefits:**
- Improved user experience across different devices.
- Better SEO performance as search engines favor mobile-friendly sites.
- Cost and time efficiency by maintaining a single codebase for multiple devices.
