HTML5 introduced new semantic elements that provide meaning to the structure of web pages. These elements help improve the readability of the code and enhance accessibility, making it easier for search engines and screen readers to interpret the content.

Semantic elements are designed to clearly describe their purpose in the HTML document. Unlike non-semantic elements such as `<div>` and `<span>`, which do not convey any meaning about their content, semantic elements provide information about the type of content they contain.
