#### What is Angular?
Angular is a platform and framework for building single-page client applications using HTML and TypeScript. Developed and maintained by Google, Angular is an open-source framework that provides a robust set of tools and features to create dynamic and responsive web applications.

#### Key Features and Benefits

1. **Component-Based Architecture**: Angular applications are built using a modular approach where the UI is divided into reusable components.
2. **Two-Way Data Binding**: This allows automatic synchronization of data between the model (business logic) and the view (UI).
3. **Dependency Injection**: Angular has a built-in dependency injection framework that improves the modularity and testability of your application.
4. **Directives**: Extend HTML's capabilities by creating custom HTML tags and attributes.
5. **TypeScript**: Angular is built with TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that provides strong typing and better tooling.
6. **Routing**: Angular provides a powerful router to manage navigation and state of application views.
7. **Forms**: Angular supports both template-driven and reactive forms, making it easier to handle user input and validation.
8. **Testing**: Built-in support for unit testing and end-to-end testing using tools like Jasmine and Protractor.
