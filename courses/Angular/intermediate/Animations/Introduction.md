Angular animations provide a powerful way to create and manage animations within Angular applications. Angular uses the Web Animations API to implement animations, offering a robust and flexible API for defining animation sequences and transitions.

#### Concepts

Angular animations allow you to:
- Enhance the user experience with smooth and engaging animations.
- Animate the entry and exit of elements.
- Create sophisticated animation sequences.
- Define animations that are reusable across components.

Angular animations are defined in the `@Component` decorator using the `animations` property and the `trigger`, `state`, `style`, `transition`, and `animate` functions from `@angular/animations`.
