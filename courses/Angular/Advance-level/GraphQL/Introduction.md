GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries by providing a complete and understandable description of the data in your API. It allows clients to request only the data they need and nothing more.

#### Introduction

GraphQL enables declarative data fetching, allowing clients to specify exactly what data they need from an API. It also provides strong typing, real-time updates, and the ability to combine multiple API calls into a single query.

**Concepts:**
- **Schema**: Defines the types and structure of the data available in the API.
- **Query**: Requests specific data from the server.
- **Mutation**: Modifies data on the server.
- **Subscription**: Provides real-time updates from the server.
