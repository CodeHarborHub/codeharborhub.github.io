## Creating Your First HTML File

To create your first HTML file, follow these steps:

1. Open your text editor.
2. Create a new file and save it with the `.html` extension, such as `index.html`.
3. Write the following HTML code in the file:

    ```html title="index.html"
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>My First Web Page</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my first web page.</p>
      </body>
    </html>
    ```

4. Save the file.
5. Open the HTML file in your web browser to view the web page.
6. You should see the following output in your web browser and try to use url `http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html` to view the web page:

    <BrowserWindow url="http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html">
        <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my first web page.</p>
    </BrowserWindow>

In this example, the HTML file contains the following elements:

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: This declaration defines the document type and version of HTML.
- `<html>`: This element is the root element of an HTML page.
- `<head>`: This element contains meta-information about the HTML document.
- `<title>`: This element specifies the title of the HTML document.
- `<body>`: This element contains the content of the HTML document.
- `<h1>`: This element defines a heading.
- `<p>`: This element defines a paragraph.
- The text between the opening and closing tags of each element is the content of that element.
- The HTML file is saved with the `.html` extension, such as `index.html`.

Congratulations! You have created your first web page using HTML. In the next section, you will learn more about HTML elements and attributes.
