Tailwind CSS includes a variety of responsive utilities that allow you to control the layout and design of your website at different screen sizes. These utilities enable you to apply styles conditionally based on the current screen size, ensuring that your website looks great on all devices.

#### Breakpoints and Media Queries
Tailwind CSS uses a set of predefined breakpoints to apply responsive styles. These breakpoints correspond to different screen sizes and are based on common device widths. Here are the default breakpoints in Tailwind CSS:

- **sm**: `min-width: 640px`
- **md**: `min-width: 768px`
- **lg**: `min-width: 1024px`
- **xl**: `min-width: 1280px`
- **2xl**: `min-width: 1536px`

You can use these breakpoints to apply styles conditionally. For example, to apply a class only on medium screens and larger, you prefix the class with `md:`.
