State variants in Tailwind CSS allow you to apply styles based on different states such as hover, focus, active, etc.

##### Common State Variants
- `hover:`
- `focus:`
- `active:`
- `disabled:`

###### Example
```html
<button class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-300 active:bg-blue-800 disabled:bg-gray-400 disabled:cursor-not-allowed text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">
